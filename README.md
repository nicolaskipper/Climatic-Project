# Climatic-Project
Project using REACT and JS.

This project was created to identify weather conditions, humidity, thermal sensation, and pressure, using AXIOS and OPENWEATHERMAP.

Additionally, the weather forecast for the next 5 days of the searched location is also included. A simple project but with great functionality
